    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <P>
        This has been a new experience for me learning how to code. When I decieded to start coding I didn't think I would get this far. especially
        because I have been out of high school for since 2018. When I had graduated college it was expensive, I couldn't afford it. Then started to try out many
        different professions and hobbies. Then I remember learning about coding and how it is becoming a growing career. I am proud of taking on coding and going 
        back to school for coding.
        </P>
