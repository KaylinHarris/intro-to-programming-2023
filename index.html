About Me
This has been a new experience for me learning how to code. When I decieded to start coding I didn't think I would get this far. especially
because I have been out of high school for since 2018. When I had graduated college it was expensive, I couldn't afford it. Then started to try out many
different professions and hobbies. Then I remember learning about coding and how it is becoming a growing career. I am proud of taking on coding and going 
back to school for coding.


experience
Code the dream is the first program or class I attended for coding. I haven't did any projects outside of Code the Dream as of yet.
